The simulation includes a track propagation system embedded in a magnetic field, electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, and a muon identification system. Physics objects that can be used for data analysis are then reconstructed from the simulated detector response. These include tracks and calorimeter deposits and high level objects such as isolated electrons, jets, taus, and missing energy. The new modular approach allows for greater flexibility in the design of the simulation and reconstruction sequence. New features such as the particle-flow reconstruction approach, crucial in the first years of the LHC, and pile-up simulation and mitigation, which is needed for the simulation of the LHC detectors in the near future, have also been implemented. The DELPHES framework is not meant to be used for advanced detector studies, for which more accurate tools are needed. Although some aspects of DELPHES are hadron collider specific, it is flexible enough to be adapted to the needs of electron-positron collider experiments.},

The simulation includes a tracking system, embedded into a magnetic field, calorimeters and a muon system, and possible very forward detectors arranged along the beamline. The framework is interfaced to standard file formats (e.g. Les Houches Event File or HepMC) and outputs observables such as isolated leptons, missing transverse energy and collection of jets which can be used for dedicated analyses. The simulation of the detector response takes into account the effect of magnetic field, the granularity of the calorimeters and subdetector resolutions. A simplified preselection can also be applied on processed events for trigger emulation. Detection of very forward scattered particles relies on the transport in beamlines with the HECTOR software. Finally, the FROG 2D/3D event display is used for visualisation of the collision final states.},

	abstract = {The need for fast simulation programs is emphasised, both in terms of the need for "rapid response" to new results - in particular from the LHC - and new theoretical ideas, and in terms of how to cope with multi-billion simulated event samples. The latter would arise both from the need to be able to simulate significantly more events than expected in the real data, also for high cross-section processes, and the need to scan multi-parameter theories. The \{{\textbackslash}it Simulation {\textbackslash}`a Grande Vitesse\}, SGV, is presented, and is shown to be able to address these issues. The tracking performance of SGV is shown to reproduce very closely that of the full simulation and reconstruction of the ILD concept. Preliminary results on how to also closely emulate the calorimetric performance from full simulation is presented. The procedure is parametric, with no the need to simulate the detailed shower development, and promises to be many orders of magnitude faster than such approaches. Contrary to what is often the case with fast simulation programs, the procedure gives a somewhat \{{\textbackslash}it pessimistic\} result, compared to the full simulation and reconstruction.},

	abstract = {It is an established fact that the Standard Model has to be extended to explain the so-called Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) phenomena: dark matter, matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe and neutrino flavour oscillations. The difficulty of direct detection of new particles lies in the huge parameter space of the possible candidates. Hence, data coming from the cosmological and astrophysical observations provide invaluable directions for laboratory experiments.In this thesis we explore two methods of constraining new-physics candidates: through their influence on the primordial nucleosynthesis and through observable differences in the matter distribution caused by free-streaming of the dark-matter particles. We concentrate on the well-motivated extension of the SM that aims at explaining all 3 BSM problems at the same time: the Neutrino Minimal Standard Model. In this extension, there are 3 additional heavy neutral leptons, one of which plays the role of dark matter, while the other two are necessary for induction of matter-antimatter asymmetry and neutrino oscillations. The dark-matter candidate is an example of a Warm Dark Matter particle, the free-streaming of which might be detected in the Lyman-α forest spectra of distant quasars. The other two particles have lifetimes that make them relevant to the primordial nucleosynthesis.},

	abstract = {The nature of dark matter is one of the most pressing questions in modern cosmology. Much work has been focussed in the past upon probing potential particle dark matter via gamma-rays resulting from its annihilation or decay. These processs are dominated by the decay of pions and thus have associated neutrino fluxes. Despite this, neutrino observations have been poor in thir ability to constrain the properties of hypothetical dark matter particles due to a lack of sensitivity. Since the gamma-ray and neutrino emissions from WIMP dark matter are expected to be correlated it becomes possible to infer an associated neutrino flux to accompany any gamma-ray flux that might be attributed to dark matter. In this work we will show that it is possible to derive superior and novel constraints, particularly on leptophilic and high mass WIMP models, with this approach. This is particularly relevant in the face of leptonic-related excesses observed in both the worlds of particle and astrophysics.},

For this we use multimessenger observations of cosmic-ray (CR) protons/antiprotons, electrons/positrons, neutrinos/antineutrinos and gamma rays. Focusing on decays into the \${\textbackslash}bar\{b\}b\$ channel, we simulate the spectra of dark matter yields by using the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi equations and the \${\textbackslash}texttt\{Pythia\}\$ package. We then propagate the CRs of dark matter origin till Earth by using the state-of-the-art numerical frameworks \${\textbackslash}texttt\{CRPropa\}\$, \${\textbackslash}texttt\{GALPROP\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}texttt\{HelMod\}\$ for the solution of the CR transport equation in the extragalactic, Galactic region and the heliosphere, respectively. Conservative limits are obtained by requiring that the predicted dark matter spectra at Earth be less than the observed CR spectra. Overall, we exclude dark matter lifetimes of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{28\}\$ s or shorter for all the masses investigated in this work. The most stringent constraints reach \$10{\textasciicircum}\{30\}\$ s for very heavy dark matter particles with masses in the range \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$ GeV.},

These include the effects of the uncertainties of wimp velocity distributions, of the uncertainties of quark densities, of large CP violating phases, of nonuniversalities of the soft SUSY breaking parameters at the unification scale and of coannihilation on supersymmetric dark matter. We review here some of these with emphasis on the effects of nonuniversalities of the gaugino masses at the unification scale on the neutralino-proton cross-section from scalar interactions. The review encompasses several models where gaugino mass nonuniversalities occur including SUGRA models and D brane models. One finds that gaugino mass nonuniversalities can increase the scalar cross-sections by as much as a factor of 10 and also significantly extend the allowed range of the neutralino mass consistent with constraints up to about 500 GeV.

the density of cold dark matter by about a factor of four, implying that the
lightest stau is only 5 -10 GeV heavier than the lightest neutralino when m\_0,

disagreement between the Standard Model prediction and the Brookhaven
measurement of the muon magnetic moment to 1.9 sigma, while using the tau decay
data plus CVC, the disagreement is 0.7 sigma. (However, the two sets of data
remain inconsistent at the 2.9 sigma level.) The recent Belle and BABAR
measurements of the B -{\textgreater} phi K CP violating parameters and branching ratios are
discussed. They are analyzed theoretically within the BBNS improved
factorization method. The CP parameters are in disagreement with the Standard
Model at the 2.7 sigma level, and the branching ratios are low by a factor of
two or more over most of the parameter space. It is shown that both anomalies
can naturally be accounted for by adding a non-universal cubic soft breaking

Models of this type apply to a large number of phenomena, and all existing bounds on the SUSY parameter space due to current experimental constraints are included. For models with universal soft breaking at M\_G (mSUGRA), the Higgs mass and b{\textbackslash}to s{\textbackslash}gamma constraints imply that the gaugino mass, m\_\{1/2\}, obeys m\_\{1/2\} {\textgreater}(300-400)GeV putting most of the parameter space in the co-annihilation domain where there is a relatively narrow band in the m\_0 - m\_\{1/2\} plane. For \${\textbackslash}mu {\textgreater} 0\$ we find that the neutralino -proton cross section {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}\{-10\} pb for m\_\{1/2\} {\textless} 1 TeV, making almost all of this parameter space accessible to future planned detectors. For {\textbackslash}mu {\textless} 0, however, there will be large regions of parameter space with cross sections {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{-12\} pb, and hence unaccessible experimentally. If, however, the muon magnetic moment anomaly is confirmed, then {\textbackslash}mu {\textgreater}0 and m\_\{1/2\}{\textless}{\textasciitilde} 800 GeV. Models with non-universal soft breaking in the third generation and Higgs sector can allow for new effects arising from additional early universe annihilation through the Z-channel pole. Here cross sections that will be accessible in the near future to the next generation of detectors can arise, and can even rise to the large values implied by the DAMA data. Thus dark matter detectors have the possibility of studying the the post-GUT physics that control the patterns of soft breaking},

outstanding riddles of cosmology and astro-particle physics. Current models
explaining the evolution of the universe, and measurements of the various

that mass is non-luminous and non-baryonic, and that a large fraction of this
so-called dark matter must be in the form of non-relativistic massive particles

In general, detectors relying on coherrent {\textbackslash}tilde\{Z\}\_\{1\}-nucleus scattering are more sensitive than detectors relying on incoherrent (spin-dependent) scattering. The dependence of the event rates as a function of the SUSY parameters are described. The detectors are generally most sensitive to the small m\_0 and small m\_\{{\textbackslash}tilde\{q\}\} and large tan{\textbackslash}beta part of the parameter space. The current b{\textbackslash}rightarrow s+{\textbackslash}gamma decay rate eliminates regions of large event rates for {\textbackslash}mu {\textgreater}0, but allows large event rates to still occur for {\textbackslash}mu{\textless}0.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The sensitivity of dark matter detectors to the lightest neutralino (\{{\textbackslash}tilde \{Z\}\_1\}) is considered within the framework of supergravity grand unification with radiative breaking of SU(2)xU(1). The relic density of the \{{\textbackslash}tilde \{Z\}\_1\} is constrained to obey 0.10 {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}tilde \{Z\}\_1\}h{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}leq 0.35, consistent with COBE data and current measurements of the Hubble constant. Detectors can be divided into two classes: those most sensitive to spin dependent incoherent scattering of the \{{\textbackslash}tilde \{Z\}\_1\} (e.g. CaF\_2) and those most sensitive to spin independent coherent scattering (high A nuclei e.g. Pb). The parameter space is studied over the range of 100GeV {\textbackslash}leq m\_0, m\_\{{\textbackslash}tilde \{g\}\} {\textbackslash}leq 1{\textasciitilde}TeV; 2 {\textbackslash}leq tan{\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}leq 20; and -2 {\textbackslash}leq A\_t/m\_0 {\textbackslash}leq 3 and it is found that the latter type detector is generally more sensitive than the former type. Thus at a sensitivity level of R {\textbackslash}geq 0.1 events/kg da, a lead detector could scan roughtly 30{\textbackslash}\% of the {\textasciitilde}parameter space studied, and an increase of {\textasciitilde}this sensitivity by a factor of 10 {\textasciitilde}would lead to coverage of about 70{\textbackslash}\% of the parameter space. Dark matter detectors are in general more sensitive to the high tan{\textbackslash}beta, low m\_\{{\textbackslash}tilde \{g\}\} and low m\_0 parts of the parameter space. The conditions of radiative breaking of SU(2)xU(1) enter importantly in analysing the efficiency of dark matter detectors},

	abstract = {We study the possibility that a dark group, a gauge group with particles interacting with the standard model particles only via gravity, is responsible for containing the dark energy and dark matter required by present day observations. We show that it is indeed possible and we determine the constrains for the dark group. The non-perturbative effects generated by a strong gauge coupling constant can de determined and a scalar potential for the dark meson fields is generated parameterizing the dark energy. On the other hand it is the massive particles, e.g. dark baryons, of the dark gauge group that give the corresponding dark matter. The mass of the dark particles is of the order of the condensation scale \${\textbackslash}Lambda\_c\$ and the temperature is 4-5 times smaller then the photon's temperature. The dark matter is of the warm matter type and it gives good fit to structure formation. The only parameters of the model are the number of particles of the dark group. The conditions to not introduce any fine tuning of the energy density at the condensation scale plus the CMB spectrum constrains the condensation scale to \$0.2 eV {\textless}{\textbackslash}Lambda\_c{\textless} 459 eV\$ and a inverse power potential with \$0.27{\textless}n{\textless}0.86\$. These values agree with the "unified dark gauge group" \$SU(3),N\_f=6, n=2/3\$ that has a warm dark matter with mass \$m=42 eV\$, a temperature \$T\_\{DM\}=T\_{\textbackslash}gamma/4.85\$ and a free streaming scale \${\textbackslash}lm\_\{fs\}=1.6 Mpc\$ with a contain mass \$M=4 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_{\textbackslash}diamond\$ (\$M\_{\textbackslash}diamond\$ is the solar mass).

In the context of DE, while current observations favour a cosmological constant picture, there are other competing models that are equally likely. This paper reviews the different possible candidates for DM including exotic candidates and their possible detection. This review also covers the different models for DE and the possibility of unified models for DM and DE. Keeping in mind the negative results in some of the ongoing DM detection experiments, here we also review the possible alternatives to both DM and DE (such as MOND and modifications of general relativity) and possible means of observationally distinguishing between the alternatives.},

	abstract = {Treballs Finals de Grau de Física, Facultat de Física, Universitat de Barcelona, Curs: 2017, Tutor: Eduard Salvador SoléIn this paper, we introduce the astrophysical problem of dark matter (DM) mainly focusing on the observational/experimental point of view. Even though DM cannot be observed directly, there are plenty of indirect observations supporting that there is more mass than we can see. This is the case for the observed properties of galaxies, galaxy clusters and the large-scale structure of the universe. We mention the implications of DM in astrophysics and high-energy physics. We then describe the DM candidates. The first group is the ordinary DM, also known as baryonic DM, in the form of astrophysical objects. The second group is non-ordinary DM or non-baryonic DM. This group encompasses all the solutions for the problem that are not in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. We end up by reviewing some current experiments that
could allow us to discover what kind of DM we are facing},

	title = {Beyond the {Standard} {Model} {Physics} at the {HL}-{LHC} and {HE}-{LHC}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07831},
	abstract = {This is the third out of five chapters of the final report [1] of the Workshop on Physics at HL-LHC, and perspectives on HE-LHC [2]. It is devoted to the study of the potential, in the search for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, of the High Luminosity (HL) phase of the LHC, defined as \$3{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ab\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ of data taken at a centre-of-mass energy of \$14{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{TeV\}\$, and of a possible future upgrade, the High Energy (HE) LHC, defined as \$15{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ab\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ of data at a centre-of-mass energy of \$27{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{TeV\}\$. We consider a large variety of new physics models, both in a simplified model fashion and in a more model-dependent one. A long list of contributions from the theory and experimental (ATLAS, CMS, LHCb) communities have been collected and merged together to give a complete, wide, and consistent view of future prospects for BSM physics at the considered colliders. On top of the usual standard candles, such as supersymmetric simplified models and resonances, considered for the evaluation of future collider potentials, this report contains results on dark matter and dark sectors, long lived particles, leptoquarks, sterile neutrinos, axion-like particles, heavy scalars, vector-like quarks, and more. Particular attention is placed, especially in the study of the HL-LHC prospects, to the detector upgrades, the assessment of the future systematic uncertainties, and new experimental techniques. The general conclusion is that the HL-LHC, on top of allowing to extend the present LHC mass and coupling reach by \$20-50{\textbackslash}\%\$ on most new physics scenarios, will also be able to constrain, and potentially discover, new physics that is presently unconstrained. Moreover, compared to the HL-LHC, the reach in most observables will generally more than double at the HE-LHC, which may represent a good candidate future facility for a final test of TeV-scale new physics.},

the Newtonian limit they become the Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger-Poisson system. Applying a
Madelung transformation, this system of equations takes the form of
hydrodynamics equations, where there are a self-interacting potential and a
kind of quantum potential that depends non-linearly on the density of the
fluid. In this theoretical framework we analyze the Jeans' instability, which
is useful for finding the scale length of perturbations of the scalar field
that will form structures. In other words, perturbations of the scalar field
with lengths less than this threshold length, can not lead to the formation of
galactic structures. We also show that this scalar field hydrodynamic system

En particular, estudiamos el sector de Higgs considerando también la posibilidad de incluir bosones más pesados que el único bosón escalar contenido en el Modelo Estándar. Más especı́ficamente, analizamos interacciones de Higgs con violación de sabor  leptónico y también la posibilidad de observar en el LHC decaimientos de bosones de Higgs pesados en canales invisibles. El primer estudio lo realizamos en el contexto del Modelo Estándar Supersimétrico Mı́nimo y está centrado en el análisis de los decaimientos de bosones de Higgs neutros en dos leptones de distinto sabor. Consideramos como fuente de violación de sabor leptónico posibles mezclas en el sector de sleptones de modo que dichos procesos se producen radiativamente a un loop. Trabajamos bajo la “Aproximación de Inserción de Masa”, es decir, no tratamos los grados de libertad internos en los loops en la base fı́sica sino en la base de interacción electrodébil. De esta manera obtuvimos expresiones analı́ticas para las tasas de decaimiento y vértices efectivos facilitando su contrastación experimental y su interpretación en términos del espacio de parámetros del modelo estudiado. Comparamos los resultados analı́ticos alcanzados con las predicciones numéricas existentes en la literatura y presentamos las estimaciones más optimistas para las anchuras parciales de decaimientos en las regiones del espacio de parámetros permitidas por los datos experimentales actuales. En el segundo estudio continuamos la misma lı́nea de análisis de decaimientos de Higgs con violación de sabor leptónico pero lo realizamos en el contexto del modelo de seesaw inverso. En este caso, la violación de sabor leptónico es generada por los acoplamientos tipo Yukawa de los neutrinos derechos pesados que se acoplan al bosón de Higgs estándar. Encontramos los vértices efectivos para introducir estas interacciones de “Nueva Fı́sica” en otro tipo de procesos como el decaimiento de un leptón a tres idénticos de distinto sabor que el inicial. Por último, en el tercer estudio, desarrollamos una estrategia de búsqueda dedicada a la producción de un par de bosones de Higgs pesados H − A del Modelo Estándar Supersimétrico Mı́nimo en el Gran Colisionador de Hadrones para una energı́a del centro de masa de √s = 14 TeV. Realizamos un análisis de los fondos para este proceso y propusimos cortes cinemáticos para maximizar la sensibilidad de la señal en el canal de decaimiento de cuatro quarks b con energı́a transversa perdida. Diseñamos una estrategia en dos regiones de señal y analizamos las posibles luminosidades de evidencia y descubrimiento en cada caso.Facultad de Ciencias Exacta},

	abstract = {En esta tesis se abordan distintos estudios fenomenológicos de posibles extensiones en el sector escalar del Modelo Estándar de partículas y sus interacciones (SM). En el primero de los estudios realizados, el SM se extiende a partir de la inclusión de una interacción de tipo pseudoescalar entre el bosón de Higgs y el quark top, y la modificación de la intensidad del acoplamiento escalar usual. La presencia del nuevo acoplamiento y, en particular, la determinación del signo relativo entre los acoplamientos escalar y pseudoescalar se examinan a partir de la construcción y posterior análisis de sensibilidad de una colección de observables impares ante CP. El estudio llevado a cabo no solo permite recuperar los observables definidos en la literatura sino que también da lugar a observables superadores cuya importancia podría evidenciarse a corto plazo en el LHC. El segundo de los estudios extiende el contenido de partículas del SM introduciendo un triplete electrodébil escalar de leptoquarks, lo cual da lugar a nuevas interacciones leptón-quark. El impacto de este modelo en el espectro de neutrinos de ultra alta energía observado en IceCube y los límites que dicho espectro impone en los nuevos parámetros son analizados cuidadosamente, con especial interés en el ligero exceso de eventos observado en la región del PeV. Asimismo, se obtienen las restricciones provenientes tanto de búsquedas dedicadas y más generales en el LHC como de observables de física de bajas energías, las cuales se contrastan posteriormente con los resultados derivados en el contexto de IceCube. Por último, en el tercer estudio también se amplía el SM a partir de la introducción de nuevas partículas, más precisamente, suponiendo la presencia de un escalar cargado. Esta extensión es puesta a prueba en el decaimiento específico tau -{\textgreater} K pi pi nu a través de la construcción y análisis de observables pares e impares ante CP. Asimismo, se investiga la utilidad de los observables propuestos para testear el modelo concreto de dos dobletes de Higgs alineados. La sensibilidad del conjunto de observables construidos podría ser explotada en el contexto de las futuras Super fábricas de mesones B.Facultad de Ciencias Exacta},

The key assumption is that the dark matter particle which is a Dirac fermion is protected from decaying by a global U(1) symmetry. We point out that quantum gravity effects will violate this symmetry and that the dark matter candidate thus decays very fast. In order to solve that problem, we propose to consider a local gauge symmetry which implies a new force in the dark matter sector. It is likely that this new local U(1) symmetry will need to be spontaneously broken leading for a range of the parameters of the model to a Sommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation cross sections which is useful to explain the Pamela and ATIC results using a weakly interacting massive particle with a mass in the TeV range},

The search is model independent, only requiring the pair production of a new light boson and its subsequent decay to a pair of muons. No significant deviation from the predicted background is observed. A model independent limit is set on the product of the production cross section times branching fraction to dimuons squared times acceptance as a function of new light boson mass. This limit varies between 0.15 and 0.39 fb over a range of new light boson masses from 0.25 to 8.5 GeV. It is then interpreted in the context of the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model and a dark supersymmetry model that allows for nonnegligible light boson lifetimes.

	abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades. In this short review, we briefly summarize theories for the origin of cosmic acceleration and the observational methods being used to test these theories. We then discuss the current observational state of the field, with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), Type Ia supernovae (SN), direct measurements of the Hubble constant (\$H\_0\$), and measurements of galaxy and matter clustering. Assuming a flat universe and dark energy with a constant equation-of-state parameter \$w = P/{\textbackslash}rho\$, the combination of Planck CMB temperature anisotropies, WMAP CMB polarization, the Union2.1 SN compilation, and a compilation of BAO measurements yields \$w = -1.10{\textasciicircum}\{+0.08\}\_\{-0.07\}\$, consistent with a cosmological constant (\$w=-1\$). However, with these constraints the cosmological constant model predicts a value of \$H\_0\$ that is lower than several of the leading recent estimates, and it predicts a parameter combination \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8({\textbackslash}Omega\_m){\textasciicircum}\{0.5\}\$ that is higher than many estimates from weak gravitational lensing, galaxy clusters, and redshift-space distortions. Individually these tensions are only significant at the {\textasciitilde}\$2{\textbackslash}sigma\$ level, but they arise in multiple data sets with independent statistics and distinct sources of systematic uncertainty. The tensions are stronger with Planck CMB data than they were with WMAP because of the smaller statistical errors and the higher central value of \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m.\$ With the improved measurements expected from the next generation of data sets, these tensions may diminish, or they may sharpen in a way that points towards a more complete physical understanding of cosmic acceleration.},

	abstract = {This chapter aims to present an introduction to current research on the nature of the cosmological dark matter and the origin of galaxies and large scale structure within the standard theoretical framework: gravitational collapse of fluctuations as the origin of structure in the expanding universe. General relativistic cosmology is summarized, and the data on the basic cosmological parameters (\$t\_o\$ and \$H\_0 {\textbackslash}equiv 100 h {\textbackslash}kmsmpc\$, \${\textbackslash}Omega\_0\$, \${\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}Lambda\$ and \${\textbackslash}Omega\_b\$) are reviewed. Various particle physics candidates for hot, warm, and cold dark matter are briefly reviewed, together with current constraints and experiments that could detect or eliminate them. Also included is a very brief summary of the theory of cosmic defects, and a somewhat more extended exposition of the idea of cosmological inflation with a summary of some current models of inflation. The remainder is a discussion of observational constraints on cosmological model building, emphasizing models in which most of the dark matter is cold and the primordial fluctuations are the sort predicted by inflation. It is argued that the simplest models that have a hope of working are Cold Dark Matter with a cosmological constant (\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM) if the Hubble parameter is high (\$h {\textbackslash}gsim 0.7\$), and Cold + Hot Dark Matter (CHDM) if the Hubble parameter and age permit an \${\textbackslash}Omega=1\$ cosmology, as seems plausible in light of the data from the Hipparcos astrometric satellite. The most attractive variants of these models and the critical tests for each are discussed.},

We study the collider signatures of the minimal secluded U(1) model, focusing on the reach of B-factory experiments such as BaBar and BELLE. In particular, we show that Higgs-strahlung in the secluded sector can lead to multi-lepton signatures which probe the natural range for the kinetic mixing angle of 10{\textasciicircum}(-2)-10{\textasciicircum}(-3) over a large portion of the kinematically accessible parameter space.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the recent proliferation of observed astrophysical anomalies, Arkani-Hamed et al. have proposed a model in which dark matter is charged under a non-abelian "dark" gauge symmetry that is broken at {\textasciitilde} 1 GeV. In this paper, we present a survey of concrete models realizing such a scenario, followed by a largely model-independent study of collider phenomenology relevant to the Tevatron and the LHC. We address some model building issues that are easily surmounted to accommodate the astrophysics. While SUSY is not necessary, we argue that it is theoretically well-motivated because the GeV scale is automatically generated. Specifically, we propose a novel mechanism by which mixed D-terms in the dark sector induce either SUSY breaking or a super-Higgs mechanism precisely at a GeV. Furthermore, we elaborate on the original proposal of Arkani-Hamed et al. in which the dark matter acts as a messenger of gauge mediation to the dark sector. In our collider analysis we present cross-sections for dominant production channels and lifetime estimates for primary decay modes. We find that dark gauge bosons can be produced at the Tevatron and the LHC, either through a process analogous to prompt photon production or through a rare Z decay channel. Dark gauge bosons will decay back to the SM via "lepton jets" which typically contain {\textgreater}2 and as many as 8 leptons, significantly improving their discovery potential. Since SUSY decays from the MSSM will eventually cascade down to these lepton jets, the discovery potential for direct electroweak-ino production may also be improved. Exploiting the unique kinematics, we find that it is possible to reconstruct the mass of the MSSM LSP. We also present decay channels with displaced vertices and multiple leptons with partially correlated impact parameters.},

A rich spectrum of particles is predicted, with a pair of light Higgs doublets accompanied by new light weak triplet and singlet scalars. The lightest of these new scalars is charged under a geometric discrete symmetry and is therefore stable, providing a new candidate for WIMP dark matter. At TeV energies, a plethora of new heavy scalars, gauge bosons and fermions are revealed, with distinctive quantum numbers and decay modes.},

	abstract = {We recently proposed a solution to the hierarchy problem not relying on low-energy supersymmetry or technicolor. Instead, the problem is nullified by bringing quantum gravity down to the TeV scale. This is accomplished by the presence of \$n {\textbackslash}geq 2\$ new dimensions of sub-millimeter size, with the SM fields localised on a 3-brane in the higher dimensional space. In this paper we systematically study the experimental viability of this scenario. Constraints arise both from strong quantum gravitational effects at the TeV scale, and more importantly from the production of massless higher dimensional gravitons with TeV suppressed couplings. Theories with \$n{\textgreater}2\$ are safe due mainly to the infrared softness of higher dimensional gravity. For \$n=2\$, the six dimensional Planck scale must be pushed above \${\textbackslash}sim 30\$ TeV to avoid cooling SN1987A and distortions of the diffuse photon background. Nevertheless, the particular implementation of our framework within type I string theory can evade all constraints, for any \$n {\textbackslash}geq 2\$, with string scale \$m\_s {\textbackslash}sim 1\$ TeV. We also explore novel phenomena resulting from the existence of new states propagating in the higher dimensional space. The Peccei-Quinn solution to the strong CP problem is revived with a weak scale axion in the bulk. Gauge fields in the bulk can mediate repulsive forces \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}6 - 10{\textasciicircum}8\$ times stronger than gravity at sub-mm distances, and may help stabilize the proton. Higher-dimensional gravitons produced on our brane and captured on a different "fat" brane can provide a natural dark matter candidate.},

	abstract = {We propose that the Standard Model is coupled to a sector with an enormous landscape of vacua, where only the dimensionful parameters--the vacuum energy and Higgs masses--are finely "scanned" from one vacuum to another, while dimensionless couplings are effectively fixed. This allows us to preserve achievements of the usual unique-vacuum approach in relating dimensionless couplings while also accounting for the success of the anthropic approach to the cosmological constant problem. It can also explain the proximity of the weak scale to the geometric mean of the Planck and vacuum energy scales. We realize this idea with field theory landscapes consisting of \$N\$ fields and \$2{\textasciicircum}N\$ vacua, where the fractional variation of couplings is smaller than \$1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{N\}\$. These lead to a variety of low-energy theories including the Standard Model, the MSSM, and Split SUSY. This picture suggests sharp new rules for model-building, providing the first framework in which to simultaneously address the cosmological constant problem together with the big and little hierarchy problems. Requiring the existence of atoms can fix ratio of the QCD scale to the weak scale, thereby providing a possible solution to the hierarchy problem as well as related puzzles such as the \${\textbackslash}mu\$ and doublet-triplet splitting problems. We also present new approaches to the hierarchy problem, where the fine-tuning of the Higgs mass to exponentially small scales is understood by even more basic environmental requirements such as vacuum stability and the existence of baryons. These theories predict new physics at the TeV scale, including a dark matter candidate. The simplest theory has weak-scale "Higgsinos" as the only new particles charged under the Standard Model, with gauge coupling unification near \$10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$ GeV.},

The WIMP is taken to be charged under a hidden gauge symmetry G\_Dark, broken near the GeV scale; this also provides the necessary ingredients for the "exciting" and "inelastic" Dark Matter interpretations of the INTEGRAL and DAMA signals. In this short note we point out the consequences of the most straightforward embedding of this simple picture within low-energy SUSY, in which G\_Dark breaking at the GeV scale arises naturally through radiative corrections, or Planck-suppressed operators. The theory predicts major additions to SUSY signals at the LHC. A completely generic prediction is that G\_Dark particles can be produced in cascade decays of MSSM superpartners, since these end with pairs of MSSM LSP's that in turn decay into the true LSP and other particles in the dark sector. In turn, the lightest GeV-scale dark Higgses and gauge bosons eventually decay back into light SM states, and dominantly into leptons. Therefore, a large fraction of all SUSY events will contain at least two ``lepton jets'': collections of n{\textgreater}= 2 leptons, with small angular separations and GeV scale invariant masses. Furthermore, if the Dark Matter sector is directly charged under the Standard Model, the success of gauge coupling unification implies the presence of new long-lived colored particles that can be copiously produced at the LHC.},

	abstract = {We propose a comprehensive theory of dark matter that explains the recent proliferation of unexpected observations in high-energy astrophysics. Cosmic ray spectra from ATIC and PAMELA require a WIMP with mass M\_chi {\textasciitilde} 500 - 800 GeV that annihilates into leptons at a level well above that expected from a thermal relic. Signals from WMAP and EGRET reinforce this interpretation. Taken together, we argue these facts imply the presence of a GeV-scale new force in the dark sector. The long range allows a Sommerfeld enhancement to boost the annihilation cross section as required, without altering the weak scale annihilation cross section during dark matter freezeout in the early universe. If the dark matter annihilates into the new force carrier, phi, its low mass can force it to decay dominantly into leptons. If the force carrier is a non-Abelian gauge boson, the dark matter is part of a multiplet of states, and splittings between these states are naturally generated with size alpha m\_phi {\textasciitilde} MeV, leading to the eXciting dark matter (XDM) scenario previously proposed to explain the positron annihilation in the galactic center observed by the INTEGRAL satellite. Somewhat smaller splittings would also be expected, providing a natural source for the parameters of the inelastic dark matter (iDM) explanation for the DAMA annual modulation signal. Since the Sommerfeld enhancement is most significant at low velocities, early dark matter halos at redshift {\textasciitilde}10 potentially produce observable effects on the ionization history of the universe, and substructure is more detectable than with a conventional WIMP. Moreover, the low velocity dispersion of dwarf galaxies and Milky Way subhalos can greatly increase the substructure annihilation signal.},

	abstract = {Tantalizing hints of the Higgs boson of mass around 125 GeV have been reported at the LHC. We explore the MSSM parameter space in which the 125 GeV state is identified as the heavier of the CP even Higgs bosons, and study two scenarios where the two photon production rate can be significantly larger than the standard model (SM). In one scenario, \${\textbackslash}Gamma(H{\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}gamma{\textbackslash}gamma)\$ is enhanced by a light stau contribution, while the \$WW{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ast\}\$ (\$ZZ{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ast\}\$) rate stays around the SM rate. In the other scenario, \${\textbackslash}Gamma(H{\textbackslash}to b{\textbackslash}bar\{b\})\$ is suppressed and not only the \${\textbackslash}gamma{\textbackslash}gamma\$ but also the \$WW{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ast\}\$ (\$ZZ{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ast\}\$) rates should be enhanced. The \${\textbackslash}tau{\textbackslash}bar\{{\textbackslash}tau\}\$ rate can be significantly larger or smaller than the SM rate in both scenarios.

In addition to the latest limits from direct and indirect detection of dark matter, ATLAS and CMS constraints on electroweak-inos and on sleptons are taken into account using a "simplified models" framework. Measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson at 125 GeV, which constrain amongst others the invisible decay of the Higgs boson into a pair of neutralinos, are also implemented in the analysis. We show that viable neutralino dark matter can be achieved for masses as low as 15 GeV. In this case, light charginos close to the LEP bound are required in addition to light right-chiral staus. Significant deviations are observed in the couplings of the 125 GeV Higgs boson. These constitute a promising way to probe the light neutralino dark matter scenario in the next run of the LHC.},

With some simple selection cuts this channel becomes nearly free of background at this \$ep\$ machine, in stark contrast with the situation at the (HL-)LHC. With a parton level analysis we show that for the \${\textbackslash}phi\$ mass range \$[20,60]GeV\$, with \$100{\textbackslash},fb{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ luminosity the LHeC is generally capable of constraining \$C\_\{4b\}{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}equiv{\textbackslash}kappa\_\{V\}{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}times{\textbackslash}text\{Br\}(h{\textbackslash}rightarrow{\textbackslash}phi{\textbackslash}phi){\textbackslash}times{\textbackslash}text\{Br\}{\textasciicircum}2({\textbackslash}phi{\textbackslash}rightarrow b{\textbackslash}bar\{b\})\$ (\${\textbackslash}kappa\_\{V\}\$ denotes the \$hVV(V=W,Z)\$ coupling strength relative to the SM value) to a few percent level (\$95{\textbackslash}\%\$ CLs).

One very distinctive feature of the NMSSM is the possible existence of a light singlet-like pseudoscalar. As this pseudoscalar may be lighter than the discovered Higgs boson without conflict with data, it may lead to LHC signatures rather different to what is usually searched for in terms of new physics. In these proceedings we will discuss studies concerning the discoverability of such light pseudoscalars. It is demonstrated that heavier scalars decaying to pairs of pseudoscalars or pseudoscalars and Z bosons may lead to discovery in a large part of the parameter space. This is especially important for the non-SM like of the two lightest scalars, as it may have an almost 100\% branching ratio for decay into pairs of pseudoscalars. In such a case the discussed channels might be our only means of discovery, also for the scalar.},

We single out three distinct and novel possibilities for light dark matter: (i) a neutralino with mass around half the light Higgs mass, in the sub-GeV to 30 GeV mass range; (ii) a neutralino with a mass around half the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass, in our examples around 60 to 65 GeV; (iii) a very light neutralino with mass around the light Higgs mass, pair-annihilating to Higgs pairs.

However, the current uncertainties in the determination of the Higgs boson couplings leave room for significant deviations from the SM expectations. In fact, if one assumes no correlation between the top-quark and gluon couplings to the Higgs, the current global fit to the Higgs data lead to central values of the Higgs couplings to the bottom-quark and the top-quark that are about 2 \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ away from the SM predictions. In a previous work, we showed that such a scenario could be realized in the Next to Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the SM (NMSSM), for heavy singlets and light MSSM-like Higgs bosons and scalar top quarks, but for couplings that ruined the perturbative consistency of the theory up to the GUT scale. In this work we show that a perturbative consistent scenario, for somewhat heavier stops, may be obtained in the presence of light singlets. An interesting bonus of this scenario is the possibility of explaining an excess of events observed in CP-even Higgs searches at LEP2.},

Such a light scalar with suppressed couplings to the \$Z\$ boson would have escaped detection at LEP due to its limited luminosity. With a factor of 1000 higher luminosity and polarized beams, the International Linear Collider (ILC) is expected to have substantial discovery potential for such states. Furthermore, searches for additional scalars at LEP and LHC are usually dependent on the model details, such as decay channels. Thus, it is necessary to have a more general analysis with model-independent assumptions. In this work, we perform a search for a light higgs boson produced in association with \$Z\$ boson at the ILC with a center-of-mass energy of 250 GeV, using the full Geant4-based simulation of the ILD detector concept. In order to be as model-independent as possible, the analysis is performed using the recoil technique, in particular with the \$Z\$ boson decaying into a pair of muons.

	title = {Genuine {NMSSM} deviations in the 125 {GeV} {Higgs} boson decays},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07159},
	abstract = {In Supersymmetry deviations from the SM signal strengths of the 125 GeV Higgs boson can occur, because of possible SUSY contributions in diagrams with loops, which leads to different deviations in signal strengths for processes with and without loop diagrams. In the Next-to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) additional deviations may occur, because of the mixing with the additional singlet-like Higgs boson and/or additional decays into pairs of light particles, like neutralinos, pseudo-scalar Higgs bosons or singlet-like Higgs bosons. In this paper we study these "genuine" NMSSM deviations in detail to check not only their possible size, but also look for correlations or anti-correlations with respect to other channels in the hope to find specific patterns in the deviations as for the SUSY contributions, which occur predominantly in processes including loops in the diagrams. The whole NMSSM parameter space is sampled in a deterministic way. The novel scanning method is discussed in detail in the Appendix. We found three different regions with "genuine" NMSSM deviations, which are largely independent of the production mode. What was surprising: some regions show negativ correlations between final states with fermions and bosons meaning if the signal strengths for fermions decrease the signal strengths for bosonic final states increase, while other regions show positive correlations. The sign of the correlations is a strong function of the mass difference between the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson and the Higgs singlet, so looking for correlations could give useful hints about the existence and mass of the singlet Higgs boson. The features of these "genuine" NMSSM effects have been investigated in representative benchmark points for each of the three regions where a single effect is dominant. These benchmark points have been detailed in the Appendix.},

	url = {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2L2GG6B8eo},
	abstract = {El objeto más redondo del mundo podría haber ayudado a resolver el problema de mayor duración en la medición: cómo definir el kilogramo.

Un kilogramo no es lo que solía ser. Literalmente. Su nombre original fue propuesto en 1793 y era "grave" (tumba), pero fue víctima de la Revolución Francesa como su creador, Antoine Lavoisier. 
Así comienza la historia de la unidad más inusual del Sistema Internacional. El kilogramo es la única unidad base con un prefijo en su nombre, y fue la última que estuvo definida por un artefacto físico, el prototipo internacional kilogramo o IPK.

Pero el problema con esta definición fue evidente por mucho tiempo. El IPK no pareció mantener su masa en comparación con 40 los cilindros similares acuñados al mismo tiempo. Por lo tanto, el objetivo fue eliminar la dependencia del kilogramo de un objeto físico. Se consideraron dos enfoques principales para lograr este fin: el Proyecto Avogadro y la Balanza de Watt.

El proyecto Avogadro tuvo como objetivo redefinir la constante de Avogadro (definida por el kilogramo, el número de átomos en 12 g de carbono-12) e invertir la relación para que el kilogramo se especifique de manera precisa por la constante de Avogadro. Este método requería crear la esfera más perfecta de la Tierra. Estaba hecha de un solo cristal de silicio de 28 átomos. Al medir cuidadosamente el diámetro, el volumen se puede especificar con precisión. Dado que el espaciado de los átomos del silicio es bien conocido, el número de átomos en una esfera se puede calcular con precisión. Esto permite una determinación muy precisa de la constante de Avogadro.

Un agradecimiento especial a Katie Green, al Dr. David Farrant, al CSIRO y al Instituto Nacional de Medidas por su ayuda. Gracias también a Nessy Hill por filmar y revisar los borradores anteriores de este video.

Existe un debate sobre si este es realmente el objeto más redondo jamás creado. Los rotores Gravity Probe-B también son esféricos con tolerancias muy bajas, por lo que, de hecho, pueden ser más redondos.

The material within the innermost barrel regions of the ATLAS Inner Detector is studied using reconstructed hadronic interaction and photon conversion vertices from samples of minimum bias events. It was found that the description of the Insertable B-Layer, which is the new, innermost Pixel layer installed in 2014, in the geometry model was missing some material components. After updating the model, data and simulation show good agreement at the barrel region. The Pixel services (cables, cooling pipes, support trays) were modified between the Pixel and SCT detectors in 2014. The material in this region is also studied by investigating the efficiency with which tracks reconstructed only in the Pixel detector can be matched to tracks reconstructed in the Pixel and SCT detectors. The track extension efficiencies in samples of minimum bias events in data and simulation are observed to agree well in the barrel region. Some discrepancies are observed in the Pixel service region at forward pseudorapidities. These studies have led to several improvements in the description of the material in the ATLAS Inner Detector simulation.},

To support this argument, we present a formulation for a parton shower at order \${\textbackslash}alpha\_s {\textasciicircum}k\$ for any \$k\$. Since some of the input functions needed are specified by their properties but not calculated, this formulation does not provide a useful recipe for an order \${\textbackslash}alpha\_s {\textasciicircum}k\$ parton shower algorithm.

The search is carried out using events containing one electron or muon, at least one b-tagged jet with large transverse momentum, at least one jet in the forward region of the detector, and missing transverse momentum. No excess over the standard model prediction is observed. Upper limits are placed on the production cross section of heavy exotic quarks: a T quark with a charge of 2/3, and a Y quark with a charge of -4/3. For Y quarks with coupling of 0.5 and B(Y to bW) = 100\%, the observed (expected) lower mass limits are 1.40 (1.0) TeV. This is the most stringent limit to date on the single production of the Y vector-like quark.},

Two-photon interactions of these particles affect the polarization of radiation propagating through the dark matter. Coherent oscillations of the Bose condensate of the particles induce periodic changes in the plane of polarisation of emission passing through the condensate. We estimate this effect and analyze MOJAVE VLBA polarization observations of bright downstream features in the parsec-scale jets of active galaxies. Through the non-observation of periodic changes in the polarization angle, we are able to constrain the photon coupling of the ultra-light dark-matter axion-like particles at the level of ≲ 10−12 GeV−1 for masses between ∼ 5× 10−23 eV and ∼ 1.2 × 10−21 eV.},

	abstract = {Dark energy and dark matter constitute 95\% of the observable Universe. Yet the physical nature of these two phenomena remains a mystery. Einstein suggested a long-forgotten solution: gravitationally repulsive negative masses, which drive cosmic expansion and cannot coalesce into light-emitting structures. However, contemporary cosmological results are derived upon the reasonable assumption that the Universe only contains positive masses. By reconsidering this assumption, I have constructed a toy model which suggests that both dark phenomena can be unified into a single negative mass fluid. The model is a modified \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology, and indicates that continuously-created negative masses can resemble the cosmological constant and can flatten the rotation curves of galaxies. The model leads to a cyclic universe with a time-variable Hubble parameter, potentially providing compatibility with the current tension that is emerging in cosmological measurements. In the first three-dimensional N-body simulations of negative mass matter in the scientific literature, this exotic material naturally forms haloes around galaxies that extend to several galactic radii. These haloes are not cuspy. The proposed cosmological model is therefore able to predict the observed distribution of dark matter in galaxies from first principles. The model makes several testable predictions and seems to have the potential to be consistent with observational evidence from distant supernovae, the cosmic microwave background, and galaxy clusters. These findings may imply that negative masses are a real and physical aspect of our Universe, or alternatively may imply the existence of a superseding theory that in some limit can be modelled by effective negative masses. Both cases lead to the surprising conclusion that the compelling puzzle of the dark Universe may have been due to a simple sign error.},

We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_c h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.120{\textbackslash}pm 0.001\$, baryon density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_b h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.0224{\textbackslash}pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965{\textbackslash}pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \${\textbackslash}tau = 0.054{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ precision, with \$100{\textbackslash}theta\_*=1.0411{\textbackslash}pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4{\textbackslash}pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m = 0.315{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8 = 0.811{\textbackslash}pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\} = 2.99{\textbackslash}pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu{\textless} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM at over \$2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

To investigate how the formation and evolution of galaxies takes place in Milgromian gravity (MOND), we present full hydrodynamical simulations with the Phantom of Ramses (POR) code. These are the first-ever galaxy formation simulations done in MOND with detailed hydrodynamics, including star formation, stellar feedback, radiative transfer and supernovae. These models start from simplified initial conditions, in the form of isolated, rotating gas spheres in the early Universe. These collapse and form late-type galaxies obeying several scaling relations, which was not a priori expected. The formed galaxies have a compact bulge and a disk with exponentially decreasing surface mass density profiles and scale lengths consistent with observed galaxies, and vertical stellar mass distributions with distinct exponential profiles (thin and thick disk). This work thus shows for the first time that disk galaxies with exponential profiles in both gas and stars are a generic outcome of collapsing gas clouds in MOND. These models have a slight lack of stellar angular momentum because of their somewhat compact stellar bulge, which is connected to the simple initial conditions and the negligible later gas accretion. We also analyse how the addition of more complex baryonic physics changes the main resulting properties of the models and find this to be negligibly so in the Milgromian framework.},

	abstract = {The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) recently reported an excess of electrons/positrons above expected background fluxes even when a double power-law background spectrum is assumed. Several dark matter models that involve TeV-scale leptophilic WIMPs have been suggested in the literature to account for this excess. All of these models are associated with the presence of a nearby dark matter clump/over-density. In this work we set out to explore how current constraints from observational data impact the suggested parameter space for a dark matter explanation of the DAMPE excess, as well as make projections of the capacity of LOFAR and the up-coming SKA to observe indirect radio emissions from the nearby dark matter over-density. We show that LOFAR is incapable of probing the parameter space for DAMPE excess models, unless the dark matter clump is in the form of an ultra-compact mini halo. Fermi-LAT limits on dark matter annihilation are unable to probe these models in all cases. Limits derived from diffuse Coma cluster radio emission can probe a substantial portion of the parameter space and muon neutrino limits inferred from galactic centre gamma-ray fluxes heavily restrict muon coupling for the proposed WIMPs. The SKA is shown to able to fully probe the parameter space of all the studied models using indirect emissions from the local dark matter over-density.},

This particle can produced in an abundant condensate state in the early universe and is argued to satisfy all the stability and weak interaction constraints of a viable dark matter candidate. This dark matter candidate is able to evade direct detection bounds and is suggested to have the best observational prospects in the form of indirect astrophysical emissions due to the decay of the d\${\textasciicircum}*\$ condensate. In this work we test the indirect observational prospects of this form of dark matter and find that its low mass \${\textbackslash}sim 2\$ GeV mean that sub-GeV gamma-rays searches have the best prospects in the Milky-Way galactic centre where we find \${\textbackslash}Gamma\_\{d{\textasciicircum}*\} {\textless} 3.9 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-24\}\$ s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, with current extra-galactic data from M31 and the Coma cluster producing constraints on the d\${\textasciicircum}*\$ decay rate two orders of magnitude weaker.},

	abstract = {We examine the structure and dynamics of the galaxies in the Coma cluster using a catalog of 552 redshifts including 243 new measurements. The velocity distribution is shown to be non-Gaussian due to structure associated with the group of galaxies around NGC4839, 40 arcmin SW of the cluster core. We apply a mixture-modelling algorithm to the galaxy sample and obtain a robust partition into two subclusters which we use to examine the system's dynamics. We find that the late-type galaxies are freely-falling into a largely virialised cluster core dominated by early types. We obtain a virial mass for the main cluster in close agreement with the estimates derived from recent X-ray data. The mass of the NGC4839 group is about 5-10\% the mass of the main cluster. Assuming the main cluster and the NGC4839 group follow a linear two-body orbit, the favored solution has the two clusters lying at 74 degrees to the line of sight at a true separation of 0.8 Mpc and moving together at 1700 km/s. The cluster core shows evidence of an ongoing merger between two subclusters centered in projection on the dominant galaxies NGC4874 and NGC4889 but offset in velocity by 300 km/s and 1100 km/s respectively. Combining these results with X-ray and radio observations, and an interpretation of the presence or lack of an extended halo around the dominant galaxies, we develop a merger history for the Coma cluster.},

Here, some concepts from string theory and topological change in quantum cosmology are used to formulate a new model for dark matter. The density profiles of dark matter halos are often modeled as an approximate solution to the Lane-Emden equation. Using the model proposed here for dark matter, coupled with previous work showing that the approximate solution to the Lane-Emden equation can be an exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations, provides a new insight into the possible nature of dark matter.},

	abstract = {Low-acceleration space-time scale invariant dynamics (SID, Milgrom 2009a) predicts two fundamental correlations known from observational galactic dynamics: the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) and a correlation between the observed mass discrepancy and acceleration (MDA) in the low acceleration regime for disc galaxies. SID corresponds to the deep MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) limit. The MDA data emerging in cold/warm dark matter (C/WDM) cosmological simulations disagree significantly with the tight MDA correlation of the observed galaxies. Therefore, the most modern simulated disc galaxies, which are delicately selected to have a quiet merging history in a standard dark-matter-cosmological model, still do not represent the correct rotation curves. Also, the observed tight correlation contradicts the postulated stochastic formation of galaxies in low-mass DM halos. Moreover, we find that SID predicts a baryonic to apparent virial halo (dark matter) mass relation which agrees well with the correlation deduced observationally assuming Newtonian dynamics to be valid, while the baryonic to halo mass relation predicted from CDM models does not. The distribution of the observed ratios of dark-matter halo masses to baryonic masses may be empirical evidence for the external field effect, which is predicted in SID as a consequence of the forces acting between two galaxies depending on the position and mass of a third galaxy. Applying the external field effect, we predict the masses of galaxies in the proximity of the dwarf galaxies in the Miller et al. sample. Classical non-relativistic gravitational dynamics is thus best described as being Milgromian, rather than Newtonian.},

Given its large volume and fine spatial resolution, spanning over 5 orders of magnitude in dynamic range, it allows an accurate modeling of the growth of structure in the universe from the linear through the highly non-linear regime of gravitational clustering. We validate the dark-matter simulation outputs using 3D and 2D clustering statistics, and discuss mass-resolution effects in the non-linear regime by comparing to previous simulations and the latest numerical fits. We show that the MICE-GC run allows for a measurement of the BAO feature with percent level accuracy and compare it to state-of-the-art theoretical models. We also use sub-arcmin resolution pixelized 2D maps of the dark-matter counts in the lightcone to make tomographic analyses in real and redshift space. Our analysis shows the simulation reproduces the Kaiser effect on large scales, whereas we find a significant suppression of power on non-linear scales relative to the real space clustering. We complete our validation by presenting an analysis of the 3-point correlation function in this and previous MICE simulations, finding further evidence for mass-resolution effects. This is the first of a series of three papers in which we present the MICE-GC simulation, along with a wide and deep mock galaxy catalog built from it.

Most analytical studies of weak lensing statistics have been limited to quasilinear scales as they relied on perturbative calculations. On the other hand, observational surveys are likely to probe angular scales less than 10 arcminutes, for which the relevant physical length scales are in the nonlinear regime of gravitational clustering. We use the hierarchical ansatz to compute the multi-point statistics of the weak lensing convergence for these small smoothing angles. We predict the multi-point cumulants and cumulant correlators up to fourth order and compare our results with high resolution ray tracing simulations. Averaging over a large number of simulation realizations for four different cosmological models, we find close agreement with the analytical calculations. In combination with our work on the probability distribution function, these results provide accurate analytical models for the full range of weak lensing statistics. The models allow for a detailed exploration of cosmological parameter space and of the dependence on angular scale and the redshift distribution of source galaxies. We compute the dependence of the higher moments of the convergence on the parameters Omega and Lambda and on the nature of gravitational clustering.},

The observed M31 transverse velocity implies that the MW and M31 will merge t = 5.86 (+1.61-0.72) Gyr from now, after a first pericenter at t = 3.87 (+0.42-0.32) Gyr. M31 may (probability p=41\%) make a direct hit with the MW (defined here as a first-pericenter distance less than 25 kpc). Most likely, the MW and M31 will merge first, with M33 settling onto an orbit around them. Alternatively, M33 may make a direct hit with the MW first (p=9\%), or M33 may get ejected from the Local Group (p=7\%). The MW-M31 merger remnant will resemble an elliptical galaxy. The Sun will most likely (p=85\%) end up at larger radius from the center of the MW-M31 merger remnant than its current distance from the MW center, possibly further than 50 kpc (p=10\%). The Sun may (p=20\%) at some time in the next 10 Gyr find itself moving through M33 (within 10 kpc), but while dynamically still bound to the MW-M31 merger remnant. The arrival and possible collision of M31 (and possibly M33) with the MW is the next major cosmic event affecting the environment of our Sun and solar system that can be predicted with some certainty.

	abstract = {(abridged) The Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxies possess rotating planes of satellites. Their formation has not been explained satisfactorily yet. It was suggested that the MW and M31 satellites are ancient tidal dwarf galaxies, which could explain their configuration. This suggestion gained support by an analytic backward calculation of the relative MW-M31 orbit in the MOND modified dynamics paradigm by Zhao et al. (2013) implying their close flyby 7-11 Gyr ago. Here we explore the Local Group history in MOND in more detail using a simplified first-ever self-consistent simulation. We note the features induced by the encounter in the simulation and identify their possible real counterparts. The simulation was set to approximately reproduce the observed MW and M31 masses, effective radii, separation, relative velocity and disk inclinations. We used the publicly available adaptive-mesh-refinement code Phantom of RAMSES. In the simulation, matter was transferred from the MW to M31 along a tidal tail. The encounter induced formation of several structures resembling the peculiarities of the Local Group. Most notably: 1) A rotating planar structure formed around M31 from the transferred material. It had a size similar to the observed satellite plane and was oriented edge-on to the simulated MW, just as the real one. 2) The same structure also resembled the tidal features observed around M31 by its size and morphology. 3) A warp in the MW developed with an amplitude and orientation similar to that observed. 4) A cloud of particles formed around the simulated MW, with the extent of the actual MW satellite system. The encounter did not end by merging in a Hubble time. The simulation thus demonstrated that MOND can possibly explain many peculiarities of the Local Group and, moreover, that non-merging galaxy encounters in MOND can produce tidal features in galaxies.},

	abstract = {The excess of cosmic positrons observed by the HEAT experiment may be the result of Kaluza-Klein dark matter annihilating in the galactic halo. Kaluza-Klein dark matter annihilates dominantly into charged leptons that yield a large number and hard spectrum of positrons per annihilation. Given a Kaluza-Klein dark matter particle with a mass in the range of 300-400 GeV, no exceptional substructure or clumping is needed in the local distribution of dark matter to generate a positron flux that explains the HEAT observations. This is in contrast to supersymmetric dark matter that requires unnaturally large amounts of dark substructure to produce the observed positron excess. Future astrophysical and collider tests are outlined that will confirm or rule out this explanation of the HEAT data.},

The main goals of AMS-02 are the search for cosmic anti-matter, dark matter and the precise measurement of the relative abundance of elements and isotopes in galactic cosmic rays. In order to identify particle properties, AMS-02 includes several specialized sub-detectors. Among these, the AMS-02 Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) is designed to provide a very precise measurement of the velocity and electric charge of particles. We describe a method to reject the dominant electron background in antiproton identification with the use of the AMS-02 RICH detector as a veto for rigidities below 3 GV. A ray tracing integration method is used to maximize the statistics of p̄ with the lowest possible e− background, providing 4 times rejection power gain for e− background with respect to only 3\% of p̄ signal efficiency loss. By using the collected cosmic-ray data, e− contamination can be well suppressed within 3\% with β ≈ 1, while keeping 76\% efficiency for p̄ below the threshold.},

	abstract = {In models with universal extra dimensions (i.e. in which all Standard Model fields, including fermions, propagate into compact extra dimensions) momentum conservation in the extra dimensions leads to the conservation of Kaluza--Klein (KK) number at each vertex. KK number is violated by loop effects because of the orbifold imposed to reproduce the chiral Standard Model with zero modes, however, a KK parity remains at any order in perturbation theory which leads to the existence of a stable lightest KK particle (LKP). In addition, the degeneracy in the KK spectrum is lifted by radiative corrections so that all other KK particles eventually decay into the LKP. We investigate cases where the Standard Model lives in five or six dimensions with compactification radius of TeV\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ size and the LKP is the first massive state in the KK tower of either the photon or the neutrino. We derive the relic density of the LKP under a variety of assumptions about the spectrum of first tier KK modes. We find that both the KK photon and the KK neutrino, with masses at the TeV scale, may have appropriate annihilation cross sections to account for the dark matter, \${\textbackslash}Omega\_M {\textbackslash}sim 0.3\$.},

The search is model independent, only requiring the pair production of a new light boson and its subsequent decay to a pair of muons. No significant deviation from the predicted background is observed. A model independent limit is set on the product of the production cross section times branching fraction to dimuons squared times acceptance as a function of new light boson mass. This limit varies between 0.15 and 0.39 fb over a range of new light boson masses from 0.25 to 8.5 GeV. It is then interpreted in the context of the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model and a dark supersymmetry model that allows for nonnegligible light boson lifetimes. In both cases, there is significant improvement over previously published limits.},

Physics objects that can be used for data analysis are then reconstructed from the simulated detector response. These include tracks and calorimeter deposits and high level objects such as isolated electrons, jets, taus, and missing energy. The new modular approach allows for greater flexibility in the design of the simulation and reconstruction sequence. New features such as the particle-flow reconstruction approach, crucial in the first years of the LHC, and pile-up simulation and mitigation, which is needed for the simulation of the LHC detectors in the near future, have also been implemented. The DELPHES framework is not meant to be used for advanced detector studies, for which more accurate tools are needed.

For scalar triangle integrals we give results for our basis set containing 6 divergent integrals. For scalar box integrals we give results for our basis set containing 16 divergent integrals. We provide analytic results for the 5 divergent box integrals in the basis set which are missing in the literature. Building on the work of van Oldenborgh, a general, publicly available code has been constructed, which calculates both finite and divergent one-loop integrals. The code returns the coefficients of \$1/{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}2,1/{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}1\$ and \$1/{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}0\$ as complex numbers for an arbitrary tadpole, bubble, triangle or box integral.},

With a certain signal power seeding, synchronization of temporal evolution can be kept between the output signal laser and the pump. The seed laser can be supplied conveniently by a CW pump power which is named bias pump power. A pulsed pump is responsible for shaping the output pulse. Stable pulsed lasers with tunable durations can be achieved under bias pump combined with pulsed pump. In addition, the temporal shape of output pulses can be controllable based on this new pulsing mechanism. Compared with conventional gain-switched fiber laser, a much simpler pulsed laser design can be provided by this novel pulsed fiber laser because it is no need to add a control unit to realize fast gain-switching.},

	abstract = {A wealth of new physics models which are motivated by questions such as the nature of dark matter, the origin of the neutrino masses and the baryon asymmetry in the universe, predict the existence of hidden sectors featuring new particles. Among the possibilities are heavy neutral leptons, vectors and scalars, that feebly interact with the Standard Model (SM) sector and are typically light and long lived. Such new states could be produced in high-intensity facilities, the so-called beam dump experiments, either directly in the hard interaction or as a decay product of heavier mesons. They could then decay back to the SM or to hidden sector particles, giving rise to peculiar decay or interaction signatures in a far-placed detector. Simulating such kind of events presents a challenge, as not only short-distance new physics (hard production, hadron decays, and interaction with the detector) and usual SM phenomena need to be described but also the travel has to be accounted for as determined by the geometry of the detector. In this work, we describe a new plugin to the \{{\textbackslash}sc MadGraph5{\textbackslash}\_aMC@NLO\} platform, which allows the complete simulation of new physics processes relevant for beam dump experiments, including the various mechanisms for the production of hidden particles, namely their decays or scattering off SM particles, as well as their far detection, keeping into account spatial correlations and the geometry of the experiment.},

During Run 1 of the LHC, however, several fundamental limitations in LHAPDF's design have became deeply problematic, restricting the usability of the library for important physics-study procedures and providing dangerous avenues by which to silently obtain incorrect results. In this paper we present the LHAPDF 6 library, a ground-up re-engineering of the PDFLIB/LHAPDF paradigm for PDF access which removes all limits on use of concurrent PDF sets, massively reduces static memory requirements, offers improved CPU performance, and fixes fundamental bugs in multi-set access to PDF metadata. The new design, restricted for now to interpolated PDFs, uses centralised numerical routines and a powerful cascading metadata system to decouple software releases from provision of new PDF data and allow completely general parton content. More than 200 PDF sets have been migrated from LHAPDF 5 to the new universal data format, via a stringent quality control procedure. LHAPDF 6 is supported by many Monte Carlo generators and other physics programs, in some cases via a full set of compatibility routines, and is recommended for the demanding PDF access needs of LHC Run 2 and beyond.},

We implemented this technique in the Ninja library and interfaced it to MadLoop, which is part of the public MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO framework. We performed a detailed performance study, comparing against other public reduction tools, namely CutTools, Samurai, IREGI, PJFry++ and Golem. We find that Ninja outperforms traditional integrand reduction in both speed and numerical stability, the latter being on par with that of the tensor integral reduction tool Golem which is however more limited and slower than Ninja. We considered many benchmark multi-scale processes of increasing complexity, involving QCD and electro-weak corrections as well as effective non-renormalizable couplings, showing that Ninja's performance scales well with both the rank and multiplicity of the considered process.},

The simulation of the detector response takes into account the effect of magnetic field, the granularity of the calorimeters and subdetector resolutions. A simplified preselection can also be applied on processed events for trigger emulation. Detection of very forward scattered particles relies on the transport in beamlines with the HECTOR software.
